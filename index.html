      <p><strong>Do you have what it takes to pick winning investments?</strong> Find out by forming or joining a student
        team and see what it’s like to be a venture capitalist. With the UC Berkeley Venture Capital Investment Competition (VCIC),
        you’ll assess real investment opportunities in early stage companies by watching company pitches, conducting due diligence
        and negotiating investments with real Bay Area entrepreneurs. You’ll learn firsthand how to value companies, construct and
        negotiate term sheets while spending a full day with high profile Silicon Valley venture capitalist judges.</p>

      <h1>Purpose</h1>
      <p>The UC Berkeley VCIC is a three-tiered progressive competition. The winning team from our UC
        Berkeley competition will advance to compete in the VCIC Regional Competition in February. Last year,
        both the Graduate and Undergraduate UC Berkeley teams won the Silicon Valley regional competition and
        advanced to the final tier. <br><br>
        VCIC aims to educate and expose UC Berkeley students to the venture capital process and the investment
        criteria considered when evaluating a business opportunity. Potential Venture Capitalist candidates have limited
        opportunities to experience the “day in the life of a VC” because of the selective nature and criteria of VC recruiting.
        VCIC’s goal is to allow students to apply the art and science of venture investing and try their hand at selecting real
        business opportunities using strategic investment criteria, valuation, capitalization tables, term sheets, and other tools of the trade.</p>

      <h1>UC Berkeley Competition Day</h1>
      <p>On Competition day, four entrepreneurs currently seeking VC funding will pitch to all six teams.
        Teams will receive business materials for these companies three days prior to the Competition.
        Following entrepreneur pitches, teams will then rotate around the entrepreneurs, one (team) on one
        (entrepreneur), where they will have the opportunity to ask specific questions about the business materials,
        while being observed by a panel of 5-6 VC judges. Entrepreneurs and VC judges will represent a diverse range of sectors and backgrounds.<br><br>
        Teams will then break out to make investment decisions and each group will develop a term sheet to pitch to a panel of VC judges, simulating
        a Monday morning VC partner meeting. Judges deliberate and then announce the top 2 teams that will compete in the final round. In the final
        round, the top 2 teams will be selected to complete a negotiation session with their selected entrepreneur in front of the VC judging panel.
        Judges provide feedback to the teams, and also provide feedback to the entrepreneurs.</p>

        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p><strong>Who organizes the event?</strong> The Berkeley-Haas Entrepreneurship Program is responsible for the UC Berkeley VCIC. A committee of BerkeleyHaas students are recruited
          each Fall to organize the event.
          <br><br><strong>Why should I participate in the Competition?</strong> The VCIC Competition provides an excellent learning experience for UC Berkeley
          students interested in venture capital and entrepreneurship, by enhancing their appreciation of the venture capital investment opportunity
          recognition and process. This occurs through both the Competition itself and through the supporting workshops leading up to it.<br>
          Potential venture capitalist candidates have limited opportunities to experience “a day in the life of a VC” because of the selective nature
          and criteria of VC recruiting. VCIC’s goal is to allow students to try their hand at selecting real business opportunities using strategic
          investment criteria, valuation, capitalization tables, term sheets, and other tools of the trade.<br>
          The Competition also provides opportunities for students to build and extend their relationships with established Bay Area venture capitalists.</p>
